# Bookshelf

This is the first self-assessment project for the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp.

The app holds a list of books and displays detailed information about each book.

Additions to the baseline project:

- Segmented control on the list view to sort by title, author, or release data.
- Swipe between books in the detail view.

When sorting books by title, a leading "A " or "The " is ignored.
